L (Samuel Jackson)\\nI\\'m for real though\\nI\\'m from Memphis, I\\'m often labeled as Trill so\\nThey stay kicking it with me like a field goal\\nSee I\\'m humble, but I live fame\\nFor more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh\\n\\nI\\'ve been hated by many, wanted by plenty\\nDisliked by some, but confronted by none\\nSince they don\\'t show me sincerity, I load up, lock up\\nTake shots at em I guess you could call it a parody\\nBut compared to D\\nThey one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me\\nIf that\\'s not how it is it ain\\'t how it appear to be\\nYou got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader\\nAnd when the psychic get to touchin my palm\\nSeein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible\\nEspecially when one of your artist feelin threatened\\nCause I\\'m harnessin a weapon, won\\'t you pardon my reflection\\nMirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage\\nTo play around, to perfection I\\'m the spittin image\\nMy verbal camp is vivid, I told you I\\'m spittin image\\nIt seems we often want to start but never get to finish\\nMy verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova\\nAnd writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over\\nLet me assist you like a specialist\\nSo you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this\\nIt\\'s not a problem wit X, I guess I\\'m a pessimist\\nWhich means if shit goes bad, I say \"I expected this\"\\nAnd me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate\\nInstead of understanding its a tune of hate\\nThe city\\'s mine like Oklahoma\\'s a Sooner state\\nAnd we\\'re gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late\\nSo, why don\\'t you walk up in the spot using less strut\\nYou aint Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut\\nAnd lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar\\nYou still a protege, that\\'s the reason I don\\'t holler\\nYou got rappers being repetitive actors\\nYou stay ahead of the game, I\\'m ahead of the practice boi \\n\\nVery few give you that truth, it\\'s either they can\\'t do it with lyrics\\nOr can\\'t do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing\\nThe samples that they using, can\\'t get through the clearing\\nI\\'ll handle it since they just can\\'t get you to hear it\\nMy father\\'s early careering forced my parents to split up\\nMy mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up\\nWith just being a florist, the choir sang his chorus\\nAnd he got back into doing what he was doing before us\\nBecause money is an issue, your son he gon miss you\\nAnd plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too\\nNow you looking for exes, you ain\\'t never expect this\\nYou end up doing time, and me I end up with a step-sis\\nNobody passing judgment, or question where the drugs went\\nYou know I hold you down because without you, I\\'d be a wasn\\'t\\nAnd mommy I\\'ma support her, I keep it all in order\\nSee her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border\\nBut\\n\\nThis is my life, and so the rest is kinda been cool, question what I been through\\nI write a verse addressing it, and yes I might offend you\\nPicture when I was in school,\\nMe being the closest thing to black, and guess what rap music what I was into\\nRest of the kids were sheltered, I never liked to fight\\nBut when someone called me a \"nigger\" I\\'d punch them I couldn\\'t help it\\nNow I\\'m grown I can say what it is\\nIt\\'s parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raising they kids\\nAnd your daddy want it very right\\nI make you happy, plus I\\'m Jewish, he don\\'t approve, I think he want you to marry white\\nHe want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White\\nBecause black is black honey, even if he\\'s very light\\nAnd so I never been for dinner at they places\\nAlways brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces\\nI live it so the case is, whether Drake is\\nWay ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist\\n\\nAm I hot as the rest, should I strive for my spot as the best\\nLike girls with Double D\\'s, I gotta lot on my chest\\nThere\\'s questions that need to be answered that\\'s not on the test\\nInstead of staring at quizzes (?) now it\\'s models with breasts\\nAnd yes, when I\\'m dismissed after a tedious listen\\nI sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician\\nHomie, I probably could of been on TV consistent\\nAn artist like Pablo, or maybe Petey\\'s assistant\\nAnd my mindset is come and get me\\nI\\'m all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain\\'t nobody running with me\\nSo, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady, daughter, and her grandson\\nNigga get the handgun\\nIf not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond\\nThat have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen\\nLast couple of months I done probably been\\nAround the world and back, and I don\\'t wanna question half the places Nick been\\n\\nSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough\\nTo feel what I\\'m about to say in this song\\nWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself\\nAnd you do it and get the feeling it\\'s wrong\\nThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping\\nAnd they try to make you out as a lie\\nSymbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason\\nIt\\'s a lose lose why even try\\nWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected, people just get neglected\\nAnd they never really know how to feel\\nPhone calls is something that you\\'re expecting for someone without the ethics\\nAnd the motives to try and make them a mill\\nYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and\\nNiggas wanna say that you ain\\'t around\\nI mean there\\'s always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming\\nthat you couldn\\'t help and maybe next time you ain\\'t in town\\n\\nYou gonna try to try harder cuz\\nTry harder cuz\\nTry Try-Try-Try\\n\\nAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting\\' is fresher\\nthan most of these rappers running the game\\nConcerned that people who copy what\\'s in the past and turn the profit with cash\\nThere\\'s time I would have done it the same\\nI mean I got me a range, Also got me a guilty conscience\\nThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent\\nSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers\\nand watched the game from the bleachers\\nBecause I\\'m really tend to need what I spent\\nIn a house that I promised to get my mother don\\'t compensate for the other time\\nI wasted late out at the club\\nInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I\\'m working hard on the winner\\nso this album is a labor of love\\nYou say as long as I\\'m staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats\\nThat she can rest without a toss and a turn\\nBecause she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV\\nThat\\'s exactly why I often get burned\\nBut I\\'m gonna try toSHAKE UP THE WORLD\\nTHAT IS WHAT I AM BOUT TO DO\\nAnd homie you ain\\'t even on my altitude\\nI\\'m tellin you, I got enough cloud for two\\nAnd like a nxgga turn blood I came out the blue\\nThey like, \"damn who\\'s drake, where\\'s wheel-chair-Jimmy at?\"\\nOn my chris brown shxt. I\\'m still here. gimme dat\\nI\\'m cuttin lights out like it\\'s bedtime\\nThese other rappers luke-warm like redwine\\nThe truth hurts so please don\\'t rub it in\\nI\\'m not signed yet, so I\\'m still budgetin\\'\\nI\\'m like jeopardy-I\\'m still buzzin in\\nEvery city that you gotta nephew or a cousin in\\n(ugh) I miss cake these days\\nI can\\'t even afford a mistake these days\\nAll of my favorite girls miss drake these days\\nPlease don\\'t take offense to my ways\\n\\nCause I need drug money\\nWho got drug money\\nI am talkin \"white phantom sittin on dub\" money\\nI am talkin \"cold champaigne at tha club\" money\\nAnd no I ain\\'t emotional but baby I love money\\nTo all these A&R\\'s that\\'s playin stars\\nWhy you gotta act dumb (dumb)\\nYour girl kno how I beat it like a flat drum\\nI spit dirty like I\\'m chewin on black gum\\nI fooled ya\\'ll ain\\'t shxt for me to come back from\\n\\nOoooohhh!\\nYes!\\nI\\'d like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this\\nextravaganza that I call Comeback Season.
